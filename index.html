                                            <h3>Badminton</h3>
        
                                                <p>Badminton has always been a passion of mine. Although my training was interrupted at age 11 due to COVID-19, I resumed at 13 and earned a spot on my high school’s Varsity team. I later placed second in BVALs and qualified for CCS.</p>
                                            <h3>Robotics</h3>
        
        
                                                <p>I joined my high school’s VEX robotics club in freshman year as part of team 6374X. I later became captain and helped lead the team to higher levels of competition.</p>

                                                <p>I was formerly part of Troop 466 in Boy Scouts, where the many camping trips created unforgettable memories.</p>
